        <p>
            This section outlines the main known issues and design choices you should consider if you’re thinking about buying this oceanfront property in Manglaralto, Ecuador.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the problems with buying a property anywhere, but especially where there are not the protections available in some places: what are the hidden issues? This is even more important with an oceanfront property where the climate is unforgiving and deferred maintenance can turn into replacement faster. With this in mind, the following information is to help you understand what you will and may want to do with the property. Everything was done with long‑term maintenance in mind. There was a house on the front of the property (the original structure before everything else was built better) which needed to be deconstructed due to quality. We had concrete tested for anything that would remain and replaced everything else. New perimeter walls in most areas, new electrical lines and plumbing. If it wasn't going to last, it was redone or removed.
        </p>
        <section class="content-block text">
            <ul>
            <li>Handrails. The handrail on the new set of stairs leading from street level to the apartment was a temporary solution and will need replacing eventually. The stairs are new and great, just the handrail needs work. In addition, the apartment balcony, and the area around the pool and street side need them. This allows you to choose your preference. Classic caña, sleek glass, marine rope style? Your choice.</li>
            <li>There is an entry on the ocean side big enough for a car or work equipment to enter. Currently is filled with a temporary wood wall. Depending on if you want to keep a parking spot there or just use it during construction and finish it out like the lovely wall next to it depends on your use decision.</li>
            <li>On the street side between the two brand new entrances is a wall made of wood and caña. It will last some years but is not permanent because what will go there also depends on how you will decide to finish out the property.</li>
            <li>The Pool. It has been filled and used, has a new pump and no leaks were ever discovered. We were not here for the original construction but we had the concrete tested by an engineer and told it is rock solid. However, the filter head and sand should be replaced by a professional at some point. The original transformer to power the lights in the pool was an exposed metal version which wasn't right for the climate. The property sale includes a much better transformer but will need to be installed by an electrician.</li>
            <li>Landscaping: Basically, there is none. Especially the large front area between the poolside lounging area and the front wall. The idea for the front wall is to plant some climbing vine type plants that add privacy and create a lovely contrast of green to the red "O" shaped blocks but let your imagination be your guide!</li>
            <li>The original set of stairs from the street level up to the apartment/pool/pergola level still exists. What to do with those depends entirely on your future use decision of the property. For the plan of putting an apartment below the pergola for example, removing the stairs and filling in the opening creates space for more use below.</li>

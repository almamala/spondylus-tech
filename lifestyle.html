      <h3>A place where time stands still</h3>
      <p>
        Manglaralto is a smaller but up-and-coming family-oriented town WITHIN
        the parroquia of Manglaralto that includes Olón and Montañita, which is
        itself within the provincia of Santa Elena (this confuses people and web
        search sometimes). Manglaralto is a place where time stands still.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mix of working-class coastal families, fishermen, and an increasing
        number of long-term expats and remote workers. There’s a strong sense of
        community and environmental awareness, with residents active in turtle
        conservation, local festivals, and neighborhood projects.

        The town square and surrounding parks are where everyday life unfolds —
        kids playing, neighbors catching up, festivals, and casual evening
        walks. It’s not a resort town vibe — it’s a real working coastal town

      The beachfront is calm and unpretentious, with cleaner stretches than

      with minimal crowds.

      One of the things that surprises people most about Manglaralto is how
      functional everyday life is without feeling commercialized. You don’t
      need to leave town for basics — and you also don’t feel like you’re living
      in a strip mall.

      <th>Healthcare</th>
      <td>
        Manglaralto has a local health center offering basic care, vaccinations,
        and minor-illness treatment, plus a few private clinics for lab tests,
        X-rays, and ultrasounds. For serious or specialized care, residents
        typically travel to hospitals in La Libertad/Salinas or Guayaquil.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Internet</th>
      <td>
        With multiple options and fiber optic available, internet here in town
        has been surprisingly reliable. For occasional power outages, buy a UPS
        backup power system for your router and you should be fine. When choosing
        a package, look at the minimum speed guaranteed, not the max or you will
        be arguing with the installer.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Getting around</th>
      <td>
        A car or motorcycle can be convenient for exploring but buses and taxis
        often become preferable. Many of us have chosen to forgo the nuisance of
        car ownership since a taxi to Olón costs a couple bucks if you want to go
        out for dinner. If you need groceries not available in town, $1.50 will
        get you to the TIA grocery store in Montañita. Buses from Santa Elena
        terminal to Manglaralto cost about $1.75 and take roughly 1 hour. A bus
        to Montañita is $0.60 and they pass by often. There are two taxi stations
        in town — you can send a WhatsApp and they will pick you up or walk the
        few blocks and grab one.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Safety</th>
      <td>
        Manglaralto is considered relatively safe compared to larger Ecuadorian
        cities, with low violent-crime rates but occasional petty theft
        (pickpocketing, vehicle break-ins). You will often read online that the
        “coast” is super dangerous but that is lumping us in with cities like
        Manta and Puerto López. The police have taken a proactive role, and
        recent security upgrades on buses have reduced bandit-style incidents.
        The Manglaralto–Olón–Montañita corridor is generally safer and more
        tourist-friendly than parts of the northern coast. Standard precautions
        advised: no valuables on the beach at night, avoid walking alone very
        late.

      integration into everyday life.

      Informal shore fishing is permitted in many areas, and some local boats

      Humpback whale season runs roughly June–October, with peak activity in
      July–September. While the top-tier whale-watching infrastructure is

        you wait for 6) or $3 for immediate departure. The trail entrance is at a
        small interpretation center. You can walk self-guided for $2 or hire a
        guide for about $22.50. Boots can be rented for $0.50 if muddy, and the
        site is generally open from about 8:00–15:00.

        About eight minutes north of Manglaralto along the Ruta del Sol, Olón is

        quieter than Montañita, with a long stretch of sand, casual beachfront

      aerial dance-style performances and community-led cultural events that
      attract both locals and foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surfing in Olón is gentler and more forgiving than Montañita, making it a
      popular place to learn. Several surf schools and board rentals operate
      directly on the beach and offer instruction in Spanish and English.

        <h2>This View, Every Day</h2>
        <p>Open the doors and the Pacific is right there — palm trees, beach, ocean. This is what you see from the bed.</p>
        <p>Sunsets in Manglaralto are consistently stunning and wildly varied. Every evening is different. Every day brings the energy of the sea, birds skimming low over the water, and the call of the waves…</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Open Floor Plan</h2>
        <p>An open layout shaped around warmth and flow — terracotta tile, cedar details, and the kind of air and light that feels different when you live in front of the sea.</p>
        <p>The apartment entry is one level up from the street, with the pool in front of you and the ocean just beyond.</p>

        <h2>Dining with a View</h2>
        <p>The dining table sits right by the window, with the pool in front and the ocean just beyond.</p>
        <p>Morning coffee here. Evening wine in the pergola. It really is a great way to live!</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Full Kitchen, Built for the Coast</h2>
        <p>A hybrid of local craft and modern design — quartz countertops, wood drawers and doors sealed with marine-grade finish, and concrete framing throughout.</p>
        <p>Living this close to the ocean is hard on everything. This setup holds up better over time, and makes repairs or replacements simpler when something inevitably needs attention.

        <h2>Doing Dishes with a View</h2>
        <p>The double sink sits directly in front of the kitchen window, looking out over the pool and toward the ocean beyond.
        <p>It turns a daily task into something quieter — a few minutes of water, light, and horizon instead of just another chore.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Built-In Living Area</h2>
        <p>A built-in couch/daybed with a cedar backboard and integrated end tables. Outlets for lamps are tucked away so you can have gentle light for reading without cords running everywhere.</p>
        <p>And speaking of cords — the wall-mounted TV above the built-in entertainment center has power and ethernet in the wall. And if you’re like me and like to watch TV while eating dinner, this is the place.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Remote Work Ready</h2>
        <p>Upstairs is cool and calm, with high-speed fiber that’s been surprisingly reliable. Ethernet is hardwired to the desk and living area TV for extra stability when it matters.</p>
        <p>Close the curtains when you want focus or privacy. Open them when you’re feeling more expansive.</p>

        <h2>Work with a Horizon</h2>
        <p>From the desk, the view opens out over the pool and the ocean beyond — but work doesn’t have to stay inside. The pergola, poolside, or anywhere on the property works just as well.</p>
        <p>Some days you want structure. Some days you want air, light, and distance. Both are easy here.</p>

        <h2>Sleeping Upstairs</h2>
        <p>Upstairs shifts into cooler tones — sea-foam tile, cream walls, cedar headboard, and soft light from locally-made-basket fixtures. The sound of the Pacific as you drift to sleep.</p>
        <p>Outlets on both sides for charging, space to move, and doors that open to breeze and sound make it easy to settle in without thinking much about it.</p>

        <h2>Upstairs Bath</h2>
        <p>Bathrooms are just hard to photograph — this is combined photo — but the bathroom is simple, solid, and comfortable to use. Same cabinet style as downstairs, paired with white quartz countertops and Briggs fixtures throughout.A large shower with clean lines and white mosaic tile underfoot.</p>
        <p>Plenty of storage, good light at the mirror, and everything laid out to work without fuss.</p>

        <h2>Front of the Apartment</h2>
        <p>A mix of glass, cedar, and warm natural tones gives a clean but earthy character.</p>
        <p>The exterior kitchen wall uses a custom brick pattern that adds texture and depth without feeling decorative — simple, solid, and built to last.
        </p>
        <p>The upstairs desk will need handrails added. Some people prefer modern glass, others classic caña — this leaves the choice open to you.</p>

        <h2>One of the Largest Pools in Town</h2>
        <p>The pool sits between the apartment and the ocean and is one of the larger ones in town. It’s currently empty, but it’s been filled and used recently and works well overall.

        <h2>Apartment First Floor Layout</h2>
        <p>The layout below shows how the living, dining, and kitchen spaces connect — open where it matters, but still easy to live in day to day.</p>
        <p>This apartment was rebuilt from structure outward — not cosmetic, but complete — including a new roof, fresh enlucido, Sherwin-Williams paints throughout, and literally every inch of wiring replaced in the last three years.</p>

        <p>Grounded outlets everywhere, modern breakers, GFCIs in wet areas, and small but meaningful details like three-way switches for stairs and bedside lighting. Little things that make daily life easier and safer.</p>

        <h2>Apartment Second Floor Layout</h2>
        <p>Upstairs connects the bedroom, bath, and workspace into a calm, functional zone — cool tones, good airflow, and everything where you’d expect it to be.</p>
        <p>The electrical panel and tankless water heater are installed indoors, the main breaker sits in a weather-resistant box, and the plumbing layout makes it easy to add a whole-apartment water filtration system if desired. Practical details that save time, money, and headaches later.</p>

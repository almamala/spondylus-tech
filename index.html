      <h2>This View, Every Day</h2>
      <p>
        Open the doors and the Pacific is right there — palm trees, beach,
        ocean. This is what you see from the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sunsets in Manglaralto are consistently stunning and wildly varied.
        Every evening is different. Every day brings the energy of the sea,
        birds skimming low over the water, and the call of the waves…

      <h2>Open Floor Plan</h2>
      <p>
        An open layout shaped around warmth and flow — terracotta tile, cedar
        details, and the kind of air and light that feels different when you
        live in front of the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        The apartment entry is one level up from the street, with the pool in
        front of you and the ocean just beyond.

        The dining table sits right by the window, with the pool in front and
        the ocean just beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Morning coffee here. Evening wine in the pergola. It really is a great
        way to live!

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Full Kitchen, Built for the Coast</h2>
      <p>
        A hybrid of local craft and modern design — quartz countertops, wood
        drawers and doors sealed with marine-grade finish, and durable frames
        throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Living this close to the ocean is hard on everything. This setup holds
        up better over time, and makes repairs or replacements simpler when
        something inevitably needs attention.

      <h2>Doing Dishes with a View</h2>
      <p>
        The double sink sits directly in front of the kitchen window, looking
        out over the pool and toward the ocean beyond. There is hot and cold
        water at every tap and the laundry area.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns a daily task into something quieter — a few minutes of sea,
        light, and horizon instead of just another chore.
      </p>

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Built-In Living Area</h2>
      <p>
        A built-in couch/daybed with a cedar backboard and integrated end
        tables. Outlets for lamps are tucked away so you can have gentle light
        for reading without cords running everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        And speaking of cords — the wall-mounted TV above the built-in
        entertainment center has power and ethernet in the wall. And if you're
        like me and like to watch TV while eating dinner, this is the place.

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Remote Work Ready</h2>
      <p>
        Upstairs is cool and calm, with high-speed fiber that's been
        surprisingly reliable. Ethernet is hardwired to the desk and living area
        TV for extra stability when it matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Close the curtains when you want focus or privacy. Open them when you're
        feeling more expansive.

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Work with a Horizon</h2>
      <p>
        From the desk, the view opens out over the pool and the ocean beyond —
        but work doesn't have to stay inside. The pergola, poolside, or anywhere
        on the property works just as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some days you want structure. Some days you want air, light, and
        distance. Both are easy here.

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Sleeping Upstairs</h2>
      <p>
        Upstairs shifts into cooler tones — sea-foam tile, cream walls, cedar
        headboard, and soft light from locally-made-basket fixtures. The sound
        of the Pacific as you drift to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outlets on both sides for charging, space to move, and doors that open
        to breeze and sound make it easy to settle in without thinking much
        about it.

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Upstairs Bath</h2>
      <p>
        Bathrooms are just hard to photograph — this is combined photo — but the
        bathroom is simple, solid, and comfortable to use. Same cabinet style as
        downstairs, paired with white quartz countertops and Briggs fixtures
        throughout. A large shower with clean lines and white mosaic tile
        underfoot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plenty of storage, good light at the mirror, and everything laid out
        comfortably for two people.

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Front of the Apartment</h2>
      <p>
        A mix of glass, cedar, and warm natural tones gives a clean but earthy
        character.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exterior kitchen wall uses a custom brick pattern that adds texture
        and depth without feeling decorative — simple, solid, and built to last.
      </p>
      <p>
        The upstairs desk will need handrails added. Some people prefer modern
        glass, others classic caña — this leaves the choice open to you.

    <div class="text">
      <h2>One of the Largest Pools in Town</h2>
      <p>
        The pool sits between the apartment and the ocean and is one of the
        larger ones in town. It's currently empty, but it's been filled and used
        recently and works well overall.

        The pergola is a great place to relax, entertain with guests, work, or nap in the hammock. It has a built in chiminea for a fire or burning palo santo.

      <h2>Apartment First Floor Layout</h2>
      <p>
        The layout below shows how the living, dining, and kitchen spaces
        connect — open where it matters, and easy to live in day to day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This apartment was rebuilt from structure outward — not cosmetic, but
        complete — including a new roof, fresh enlucido, Sherwin-Williams paints
        throughout, and literally every inch of wiring replaced in the last
        three years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grounded outlets everywhere, modern breakers, GFCIs in wet areas, and
        small but meaningful details like three-way switches for stairs and
        bedside lighting. Little things that make daily life easier and safer.

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Apartment Second Floor Layout</h2>
      <p>
        Upstairs connects the bedroom, bath, and workspace into a calm,
        functional zone — cool tones, good airflow, and everything where you'd
        expect it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        The electrical panel and tankless water heater are installed indoors,
        the main breaker sits in a weather-resistant box, and the plumbing
        layout makes it easy to add a whole-apartment water filtration system if
        desired. Practical details that save time, money, and headaches later.

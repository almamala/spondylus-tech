          This property offers multiple development paths, and none of them are
          rigid. You can use the options below as-is, combine elements from
          different strategies, or simply hold the property and enjoy life while
          it appreciates in an up-and-coming coastal market. Whether you hire a
          contractor to manage construction or oversee work yourself, being
          on-site gives you a major advantage in cost control, quality, and
          timing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, the property already includes a lovely apartment, large
          pool, pergola, garage, and multiple structurally prepared or
          open-to-sky areas that can be built out over time — from single
          additional units to multi-unit layouts — depending on your goals,
          timeline, and budget.

          <h2>Option 1 — Add One Additional Apartment (Below Pergola)</h2>
          <p>
            Columns and beams are already in place, and architectural plans have
            been approved for a one-bedroom open-plan unit. This makes it one of
            the lowest-cost and lowest-complexity ways to expand usable space on
            the property.
          </p>
          <p><strong>You end up with:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your existing apartment</li>
            <li>One additional independent unit</li>
            <li>Pool, pergola, and outdoor spaces unchanged</li>
            <li>All other buildable areas preserved for later development</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>This works well if you want:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>A guest apartment for friends or family</li>
            <li>Rental income without committing to a larger project</li>
            <li>A staged approach: live first, build more later if desired</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You still have approximately 112 m² of structured, easy-to-build
            space and 315 m² of clear-to-sky buildable space available for
            whatever you want to do next.

        <div class="text">
          <h2>Option 2 — Build Out All Existing Easy-to-Develop Areas</h2>
          <p>
            This option focuses on converting the spaces that already have
            structure in place: below the pergola, below the plataforma, the
            garage, and the existing bodegas. These areas will cost less to
            build out than starting from open ground, since columns, beams,
            riostras (floor beams), or enclosed shells already exist.
          </p>

          <p>
            This approach maximizes usable interior space while keeping all
            clear-to-sky areas untouched for future projects, gardens, or
            larger-scale development later.
          </p>

          <p><strong>You end up with:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your existing apartment</li>
            <li>
              Multiple additional interior spaces that can become apartments,
              guest rooms, studios, or other uses
            </li>
            <li>Pool, pergola, and outdoor areas unchanged</li>
            <li>All open land preserved for future development</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>This works well if you want:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>A larger family compound</li>
            <li>Rental income from multiple units</li>
            <li>
              A phased build strategy without committing to full-site
              development
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You still have approximately 315 m² of clear-to-sky buildable space
            available for future use.

          <h2>Option 3 — Build Street-Side Apartments, Keep Ocean Side Open</h2>

          <p>
            This option uses the open-to-sky area on the street side to add new
            apartments, while keeping the ocean side and all existing structures
            unchanged for gardens, future development, or simply open space.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of the layout, this area can support multiple levels,
            allowing you to create substantial usable space without touching the
            pool, pergola, or beachfront areas.
          </p>

          <p><strong>You end up with:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your existing apartment</li>
            <li>New units on the street side</li>

            <li>Ocean side preserved for future use</li>
            <li>
              (hint: if you're a private person like me, build the apartment
              below the pergola too, live there and rent the rest. You'll have
              the whole front garden space to yourself :))
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>This works well if you want:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rental income while keeping open space</li>
            <li>
              Clear separation between living areas and recreational areas
            </li>
            <li>Maximum flexibility for future development</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You still have approximately 192 m² of structured, easy-to-build
            space and 240 m² of clear-to-sky buildable space available for
            whatever you want to do next!

            One of the largest pools in town wasn't built for one apartment — it

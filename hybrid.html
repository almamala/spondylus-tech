      <h2>Option 1 — Add One Additional Apartment (Below Pergola)</h2>
      <p>
        Columns and beams are already in place, and architectural plans have
        been approved for a one‑bedroom open‑plan unit. This makes it one of
        the lowest‑cost and lowest‑complexity ways to expand usable space on
        the property.
      </p>
      <p><strong>You end up with:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your existing apartment</li>
        <li>One additional independent unit</li>
        <li>Pool, pergola, and outdoor spaces unchanged</li>
        <li>All other buildable areas preserved for later development</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>This works well if you want:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A guest apartment for friends or family</li>
        <li>Rental income without committing to a larger project</li>
        <li>A staged approach: live first, build more later if desired</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You still have approximately 112 m² of structured, easy‑to‑build
        space and 315 m² of clear‑to‑sky buildable space available for
        whatever you want to do next.

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Option 2 — Build Out All Existing Easy-to-Develop Areas</h2>
      <p>
        This option focuses on converting the spaces that already have
        structure in place: below the pergola, below the plataforma, the
        garage, and the existing bodegas. These areas will cost less to
        build out than starting from open ground, since columns, beams,
        riostras (floor beams), or enclosed shells already exist.
      </p>


      <p>
        This approach maximizes usable interior space while keeping all
        clear‑to‑sky areas untouched for future projects, gardens, or
        larger‑scale development later.
      </p>


      <p><strong>You end up with:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your existing apartment</li>
        <li>
          Multiple additional interior spaces that can become apartments,
          guest rooms, studios, or other uses
        </li>
        <li>Pool, pergola, and outdoor areas unchanged</li>
        <li>All open land preserved for future development</li>
      </ul>


      <p><strong>This works well if you want:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A larger family compound</li>
        <li>Rental income from multiple units</li>
        <li>
          A phased build strategy without committing to full‑site
          development
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You still have approximately 315 m² of clear‑to‑sky buildable space
        available for future use.

  <!-- Option 3 — Build Street-Side Apartments, Keep Ocean Side Open -->

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Option 3 — Build Street-Side Apartments, Keep Ocean Side Open</h2>


      <p>
        This option uses the open‑to‑sky area on the street side to add new
        apartments, while keeping the ocean side and all existing structures
        unchanged for gardens, future development, or simply open space.
      </p>


      <p>
        Because of the layout, this area can support multiple levels,
        allowing you to create substantial usable space without touching the
        pool, pergola, or oceanfront areas.
      </p>


      <p><strong>You end up with:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your existing apartment</li>
        <li>New units on the street side</li>
        <li>Pool, pergola, and outdoor areas unchanged</li>
        <li>Ocean side preserved for future use</li>
        <li>
          (hint: if you're a private person like me, build the apartment
          below the pergola too, live there and rent the rest. You'll have
          the whole front garden space to yourself :))
        </li>
      </ul>


      <p><strong>This works well if you want:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rental income while keeping open space</li>
        <li>
          Clear separation between living areas and recreational areas
        </li>
        <li>Maximum flexibility for future development</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You still have approximately 192 m² of structured, easy‑to‑build
        space and 240 m² of clear‑to‑sky buildable space available for
        whatever you want to do next!

      <h2>The Pool as an Asset</h2>
      <p>
        At roughly 90 m² with a lounge deck and ocean backdrop, the pool was
        built at a scale that supports both private living and multi‑unit
        use.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can treat it purely as a personal amenity, or as part of a
        rental, hospitality, or mixed‑use strategy — depending entirely on
        how you want to live and operate the property.

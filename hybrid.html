    <!-- Intro -->
    <section class="intro" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
      <p>This property offers multiple development paths, and none of them are rigid.

You can use the options below as-is, combine elements from different strategies, or simply hold the property and enjoy life while it appreciates in an up-and-coming coastal market. Whether you hire a contractor to manage construction or oversee work yourself, being on-site gives you a major advantage in cost control, quality, and timing.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the property already includes a lovely apartment, large pool, pergola, garage, and multiple structurally prepared or open-to-sky areas that can be built out over time — from single additional units to multi-unit layouts — depending on your goals, timeline, and budget.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Your Rental Unit: Ready to Build</h2>
        <p><strong>Below the pergola:</strong> ~80 m² permitted 1BR apartment. Plans approved, fees paid. Buyer pays ~$50 to re-initiate permit and schedule final inspection. Shovel-ready.</p>
        <p>This isn't "potential" — it's permitted and waiting. One inspector sign-off, and you can break ground.</p>
        <p>Rental income: Manglaralto + Montañita corridor sees consistent Airbnb demand. A finished unit here can generate $1,500–3,000/month depending on season and listing quality.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Or: Finish What's Started Below the Plataforma</h2>
        <p><strong>Below the plataforma (lounging area):</strong> ~29 m² with columns and floor beams already constructed. Pour the floor, add blocks = usable studio apartment or basic Airbnb.</p>
        <p>Less space, less work, faster to market. Ideal for budget-conscious builders or as a secondary rental unit.</p>

        <h3>Or: Keep It for Family</h3>
        <p>Not interested in rentals? Use the plataforma space for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Guest quarters for visiting family</li>
          <li>Work-from-home studio with ocean views</li>
          <li>Storage + open-air gathering space</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Or: Use the Bodegas</h3>
        <p><strong>Bodegas (storage):</strong> ~33 m² of covered space. In a "maximize income" scenario, this could become basic lodging or flexible event space. In a "live here" scenario, it's secure storage for water equipment, tools, seasonal items.</p>

        <h2>The Pool is a Rental Amenity</h2>
        <p>One of the largest pools in town wasn't built for one apartment — it was built for a complex. ~90 m² of water, lounge deck, ocean backdrop.</p>
        <p>As an Airbnb host, this is your competitive advantage. "Beachfront with private pool" commands premium rates and attracts families, groups, and couples willing to pay for the experience.</p>
